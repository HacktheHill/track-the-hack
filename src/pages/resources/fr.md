# Zen Goes To HackHers! 

### A Being With a Dream

Lightyears away in the cosmos, Zen was out on yet another adventure, this time on the lookout for Earth. Zen first heard of Earth when they logged on to Intergalactic Instagram and saw a poster for an event called "HackHers". As a hardware enthusiast, it was Zen's childhood dream to win a hackathon. Realising that HackHers is a gender diverse hackathon ideal for beginners with tons of events and workshops, Zen wasted no time and immediately jumped into their spaceship and set a course to planet Earth on Cosmos Maps. 

"Time to destination, thirteen hours, that's not too bad", Zen whispered to themselves. 

The first few hours of the journey went smoothly, however around hour 7, the spaceship started making a quiet rumbling noise. Zen assumed it was a local wormhole and paid no attention. But the rumbling noise grew louder, and the spaceship's control panel began to flicker. Soon, the lights went out in the spaceship and the spaceship went into hyperdrive, knocking Zen temporarily unconscious. 

...

"Where... am I" whispered Zen as they processed their surroundings. 

"You're in Ottawa, the parliament is right there!"

Zen jumped in shock to see a talking beaver. Beavers on their planet did not talk in English. In fact, they were surprised to hear any English at all on this strange planet. 

Bea.var observed Zen's reaction and reassured them. "Don't worry, I'm the only beaver that can speak. It's my unique talent!"

A little shaken, Zen asked, "What planet is this?"

"Earth! And nice to meet you, I'm Bea.var." replied Bea.var. 

"Earth?! I guess the system malfunction didn't deter me from my original course, thankfully!", sighed Zen, warming up to the friendly beaver. 

"Hi Bea.var, I'm Zen. I'm trying to get to HackHers, the gender-diverse hardware-focused hackathon. Do you know how to get to it? I heard it was hosted on Earth but it is a much bigger planet than I had expected!"

"You've come to just the right person! Or should I say, the right beaver. It's hosted on the University of Ottawa campus, very close to where we are! But first, let's make sure you are adapting well to Earth's environment, shall we?"


## Challenge 1 - Life Analyzer (Focus: Hardware)

As Zen rummaged through their backpack for electrical scraps they came across a few microprocessors and a few sensors. An idea sparked in their mind, they could create a physical well-being analyzer tool to perform a quick check-up on themselves. 

You can find details of Zen's makeshift analyzer on the project demos document. 

Your first mission is to help Zen make sure they are doing okay, physically and mentally, on this new planet. Zen’s quick little invention could only do so much in that regard. 


#### Success Criteria

- The project can measure basic health and vital signs
- Even if the project is not entirely implementable with the available resources, the focus is more on hardware design than software design, with a working prototype that fits the theme
- The project is adaptable given the scenario
- The project has multiple implemented and theoretical components that integrate well
- The project is user-friendly


### Zen Walks To Hackhers

After checking that their vitals were functioning properly, and they did not sustain any damage from the spaceship accident that could negatively impact their physical and mental state, Zen turned back to Bea.var. 

“Perfect, looks like I’m doing all right! Now time to build a cool hardware project at HackHers! Would you like to come with me, Bea.var?” 

“I’m afraid I must stay here and guide others trying to get to Hackhers. At the same time, I’ll make sure no further harm comes to your spaceship! Have fun at HackHers, Zen.” replied Bea.var with a warm smile. 

And with that, they waved at each other and Zen started walking in the direction Bea.var directed them. On the way, Zen noticed a thrift store that sold electronic parts, and a new idea struck them! They quickly walked into the store and rushed to the electronics section to look for spare parts to build a movement tracker to track their steps to the CRX building at the University of Ottawa campus. This would help Zen check that they weren’t getting too anxious on the way, and also help retrace their way back to the spaceship and Bea.var. 


## Challenge 2 - Movement Tracker (Focus: Hardware)

Zen knew that regular monitoring of activities like exercise, sleep, and nutrition can lead to increased awareness and motivation to maintain healthy habits, which are known to boost mood and reduce stress. 
Zen had unfortunately forgotten their Cosmos Watch back at their home, and they were curious if they could quickly whip up something useful and convenient to replace it. You can find details of Zen’s improvised wearable on the **project demos document**. 

As a fellow hacker at HackHers, your goal is to develop a small, potentially wearable health monitoring device, which could be incorporated into everyday items like glasses or jewellery. This could be similar to devices like smart watches or glasses. This device should be able to track relevant user health metrics. Examples of metrics include heart rate, body temperature, EMG data, step counter, and blood oxygen level. 


#### Success Criteria

- The project can measure movement, along with basic health and vital signs
- Even if the project is not entirely implementable with the available resources, the focus is more on hardware design than software design, with a working prototype that fits the theme
- The project is adaptable given the scenario
- The project has multiple implemented and theoretical components that integrate well
- The project is user-friendly


### Zen Fixes The Spaceship Dashboard

When Zen started thinking about the drive back home, they got a little nervous with all the space travel ahead of them. Zen had been flying since they were a year old, but after the malfunction on their way to Earth, they were feeling uncertain. Furthermore, the crash had somehow entirely damaged the dashboard, even though the rest of the ship was okay for flight. 

This is when Zen reached out to their smart peers at HackHers, to help Zen build a new and improved advanced spaceship dashboard that would help them get home safe. 


## Challenge 3 - Smart Space Dashboard (Focus: Software)

The original dashboard on Zen’s thrifted spaceship had a somewhat lacking dashboard to begin with. You can see the old dashboard on the **project demos document**. 

Your task is to come up with a software that emulates the Zen’s new advanced dashboard, along with a plan on the hardware that goes along with the dashboard to support better monitoring features. 


#### Success Criteria

- The project resembles a dashboard combining data from various sources (does not have to be real data) 
- The project focuses on software, with some optional hardware components, and a design that goes past the implementation, explaining how the software would integrate with hardware. 
- The project is adaptable given the scenario
- The project is user-friendly


### Zen Goes Back Home

After a fruitful and productive hackathon, it is time for Zen to go back home. With their spaceship dashboard fixed up, better than ever before with the engineering feats of their HackHers colleagues, they were excited for their drive back home. 

Zen walked back to the original crash site, where Bea.var was sitting patiently, guarding the spaceship from any harm. 

“Bea.var you’re still here! Thank you so much for looking after my spaceship”, exclaimed Zen. 

“It’s my pleasure, Zen. Did you have a positive experience at HackHers?”, asked Bea.var. 

“Absolutely! I was surrounded by so many amazing and smart people who shared so many of the same interests as me, and I learned so much from them. I’ll definitely be back next year!” 

“See you then, Zen!” 

Zen and Bea.var waved at each other as Zen boarded their spaceship, filled with joy from their experience at HackHers, and excitement for the future with all their newly acquired knowledge.
