## üåê How to use GitHub

[github.com](http://github.com/) must be used to store all your team‚Äôs projects. Judges and anyone interested in your project will be viewing the code you store in your GitHub repository. GitHub allows everyone to collaborate on the same code by providing version control (similar to viewing edit history in Google Docs). It can help you manage and keep track of the code that your team writes.
